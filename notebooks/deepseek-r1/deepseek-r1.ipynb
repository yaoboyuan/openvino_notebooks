    "# LLM reasoning with DeepSeek-R1 distilled models\n",
    "\n",
    "[DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf) is an open-source reasoning model developed by DeepSeek to address tasks requiring logical inference, mathematical problem-solving, and real-time decision-making. With DeepSeek-R1, you can follow its logic, making it easier to understand and, if necessary, challenge its output. This capability gives reasoning models an edge in fields where outcomes need to be explainable, like research or complex decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distillation in AI creates smaller, more efficient models from larger ones, preserving much of their reasoning power while reducing computational demands. DeepSeek applied this technique to create a suite of distilled models from R1, using Qwen and Llama architectures. That allows us to try DeepSeek-R1 capability locally on usual laptops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we consider how to run DeepSeek-R1 distilled models using OpenVINO.\n",

    "Additionally, we can configure parameters for decoding. We can create the default config with `ov_genai.GenerationConfig()`, setup parameters, and apply the updated version with `set_generation_config(config)` or put config directly to `generate()`. It's also possible to specify the needed options just as inputs in the `generate()` method, as shown below, e.g. we can add `max_new_tokens` to stop generation if a specified number of tokens is generated and the end of generation is not reached. We will discuss some of the available generation parameters more deeply later.  Generation process for long response may be time consuming, for accessing partial result as soon as it is generated without waiting when whole process finished, Streaming API can be used. Token streaming is the mode in which the generative system returns the tokens one by one as the model generates them. This enables showing progressive generations to the user rather than waiting for the whole generation. Streaming is an essential aspect of the end-user experience as it reduces latency, one of the most critical aspects of a smooth experience. In code below, we implement simple streamer for printing output result. For more advanced streamer example please check openvino.genai [sample](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/samples/python/multinomial_causal_lm)."

You can find more detailed info about  tokenization theory and OpenVINO Tokenizers in this [tutorial](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks/blob/latest/notebooks/openvino-tokenizers/openvino-tokenizers.ipynb). Then tokenized input passed to LLM for making prediction of next token probability. The way the next token will be selected over predicted probabilities is driven by the selected decoding methodology.  You can find more information about the most popular decoding methods in this [blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate). The sampler's goal is to select the next token id is driven by generation configuration. Next, we apply stop generation condition to check the generation is finished or not (e.g. if we reached the maximum new generated tokens or the next token id equals to end of the generation).  If the end of the generation is not reached, then new generated token id is used as the next iteration input, and the generation cycle repeats until the condition is not met. When stop generation criteria are met, then OpenVINO Detokenizer decodes generated token ids to text answer. \n",

To keep conversational history, we should move LLMPipeline to chat mode using `start_chat()` method.\n",
